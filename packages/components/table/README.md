# RCK | React Table Component

Thee Styled React Table component is a versatile solution for creating visually appealing and structured tables in React applications. 
This component provides styles and layouts to table-specific elements by using them as children.

By incorporating `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements as children, developers gain precise control over the appearance and structure of their tables. Each child element represents a distinct part of the table, enabling developers to style headers, body rows, and individual cells according to their design requirements.

> **NOTE:** You may prefer to use `DataTable` component as it can receive directly a JSON structure that supports React nodes.

### Installation 

To integrate the this component into your React apps, you can install it using npm or yarn: `npm i --save @rck/table` or `yarn add @rck/table`.
